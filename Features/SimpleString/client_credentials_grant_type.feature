  In order get a protected resource
  A client must get an Access Token
  Using a valid request to the Token Endpoint

  Scenario: The request is valid and an access token is issued
    Given I add key "X-OAuth2-Public-Client-ID" with value "PUBLIC-foo" in the header
    And I add key "scope" with value "scope1 scope2" in the body request
    And I add key "grant_type" with value "client_credentials" in the body request
    When I post the request to "https://oauth2.test/oauth/v2/token"
    Then I should receive an OAuth2 exception with message 'invalid_client' and description 'The client is not a confidential client'
    And the status code of the response is 400

    When I post the request to "https://oauth2.test/oauth/v2/token"
    Then I should receive an OAuth2 response
    And the response is not an OAuth2 Exception
    And the response contains an access token

  Scenario: The request is valid but the client is not authorized
