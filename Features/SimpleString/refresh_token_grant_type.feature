Feature: A client request an access token using the Refresh Token Grant Type
  In order renew an access token
  A client must have a Refresh Token
  And use it once

  Scenario: The request is invalid (refresh token expired)
    Given I add key "X-OAuth2-Public-Client-ID" with value "PUBLIC-foo" in the header
    And I add key "scope" with value "scope1 scope2" in the body request
    And I add key "grant_type" with value "refresh_token" in the body request
    And I add key "refresh_token" with value "INVALID_REFRESH_TOKEN_FOO" in the body request
    When I post the request to "https://oauth2.test/oauth/v2/token"
    Then I should receive an OAuth2 exception with message 'invalid_grant' and description 'Refresh token has expired'
    And the status code of the response is 400

  Scenario: The request is valid and an access token is issued
    Given I add key "X-OAuth2-Public-Client-ID" with value "PUBLIC-foo" in the header
